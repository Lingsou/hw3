1. line(x, height-10, x+random(-10, 10), height-10-random(h))shows the draw the blade of grass.
2. if (random() > 0.999) {
    fill(255);
    rect(0, 0, width, height-15);
    h = 10;
    The code on top makes the lawnmower come by.
3. variable h represent the growing height of the grass whenever x > width.
4. Height - 10 represent where the grass start growing, it minus the the height of the brown rectangle at the bottom.
